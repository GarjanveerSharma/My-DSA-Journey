# My-DSA-Journey

🚀 DSA Journey with C++ (LeetCode Practice)
I'm currently focused on mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++, as part of my long-term goal to become a strong problem solver and software developer. To put theory into practice, I'm actively solving problems on LeetCode, one of the most recognized platforms for technical interview preparation.

So far, I've solved 400+ problems across various difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, and Hard), and I'm proud to have earned 12 achievement badges along the way. With each question, I'm learning to write cleaner, more efficient code and understand the underlying principles that make algorithms work.

This is just the beginning — my target is much higher, and I'm committed to consistently pushing my limits. I'm documenting my progress and reflecting on key learnings to reinforce concepts and track improvement. Feel free to check out the code, follow along!

(276+) coding streak :)
